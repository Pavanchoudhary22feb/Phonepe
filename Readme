# PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization

## Overview
This dashboard offers insights into PhonePe's transaction data, highlighting trends and patterns across various parameters. It's built using Python and visualizes the data through a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard.

## Components

- `Phonepe_Data_Exploration.ipynb`: Script to process JSON data, Analyzed, cleaning, mapping, loading into structured CSVs and finaly insert them into a MySQL database.
- `Phonepe_Visual_App.py' cation for visualizing the data.

## Getting Started

### Library used for Phonepe Projects 
- import pandas as pd            # For data manipulation and analysis using DataFrames.
- import numpy as np             # For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- import os                      # For interacting with the operating system (e.g., file paths).
- import json                    # For parsing and handling JSON data.
- import mysql.connector as sql  # For connecting to and querying a MySQL database.
- import geopandas as gpd        # For working with geospatial data (maps, shapes, etc.).
- from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz, process  # For fuzzy string matching and similarity scoring.
- import requests, zipfile, io   # For making HTTP requests, handling ZIP files, and in-memory streams.
- import plotly.express as px              # For creating interactive visualizations and charts.
- import streamlit as st                   # For building and displaying interactive web apps in Python.
- from streamlit_option_menu import option_menu  # For creating sidebar or navbar-style option menus in Streamlit.
- import io                                # For handling in-memory file operations (e.g., reading/writing buffers).
- import requests                          # For sending HTTP requests to access web APIs or download content.

### Setting up the SQL Database and connector
1.Mydb = sql.connect(host = "localhost",
                   user = "User Name",
                   password = "Password",
                   database = "Data Base name")
mycursor = Mydb.cursor(buffered=True)
cursor = Mydb.cursor()
    ```

### Running the Data Extraction Script

#url = "https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse/archive/refs/heads/master.zip"
#extract_path = "D:/DSprojects/Phonepe/pulse_data"

#r = requests.get(url)
#z = zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(r.content))
#z.extractall(extract_path)

### Launching the Phonepe_Visual_App through anaconda prompt
Run the streamlit Phonepe_Visual_App:
```
cd /d D:\DSprojects\Phonepe
	streamlit run Phonepe_Visual_App.py
My files are in D drive therefore have to give a path```

## Features

- Data Extraction: Automates processing of raw JSON data into structured formats.
- Interactive Dashboard: Dynamic visualization with filters for different data perspectives.
- Geographical Insights: Transaction data visualization on a choropleth map of India.
- User Growth Analysis: Displays user growth trends over time.

## File Descriptions

- `Phonepe_Data_Exploration.ipynb`: Processes raw PhonePe data.
- `Phonepe_Visual_App.py`: Streamlit app for data visualization.

## Further Development

- UI Enhancement: Improve the user interface for better user experience.
- Expanded Data Utilization: Map sate & district to match our JSON file to render India Map for .batter user experience.
- Enhanced Visualizations: Develop more sophisticated visualizations for the top data insights page.
- State & District-Level Detail: Incorporate more granular, state & district-level details in the geographical insights map.
